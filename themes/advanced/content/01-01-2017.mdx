Look, sometimes you just need some money that's not tied up in things like being backed by a whole nation or doing pseudointellectual stuff like automatically taxing people and kind of giving them their money back in the form of a shell game.

That's where just having some generic money comes in. Stablecoins are overregulated and will only become moreso. The big name brand coins are all manipulated and toyed with constantly. 

Really, what this market needs is just like, you know... "Meh."
